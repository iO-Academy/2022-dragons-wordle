            Guess the 5 letter word!

            You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.

            Enter your guess from the virtual keypad or your keyboard letters, then press 'submit'.

            Each guess must be 5 letters long, with no numbers or spaces.

            Each tile will change colour to reflect the accuracy of your guess.

            Green = The letter is in the right place

            Yellow = The letter is in the word, but not in the right place

            Dark grey = The letter is not in the word

            After the game has finished, you can play again by clicking the 'Replay' button

            Have fun WordNerd (glasses emoji)!
